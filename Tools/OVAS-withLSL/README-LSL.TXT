This is a special build of the OpenViBE acquisition server based on version 0.14.3-svn3350 which has support for the lab streaming layer compiled in.
The modified sources are found in openvibe-applications.

For a basic test, try to start the Generic Oscillator or OpenAL audio source. Then open the LabRecorder that comes with LSL to record the data streams.
